This directory contains a subset of three.js used by UglyMol.

The reason for creating this subset was to make the UglyMol bundle small.
We use less than 1/10 of the three.js code. In 2018, before three.js
transitioned to ES6 modules, automatic tree-shaking wasn't helping at all.
Nowadays, bundling tools can remove unused classes, but here we also
eliminate unused methods and sometimes even unnecessary code from the methods.

Initially, in 2018, this subset was derived from r83 (r stands for revision,
that's how three.js is versioned). In 2024, I partly updated it to r162.
Partly -- because updating everything turned out to be too time-consuming.

The code was reformatted automatically (eslint --fix, prettier) and manually.

Being compatible with the most popular WebGL library could make starting
easier for new developers. But our use of three.js is superficial.
No lights, no perspective, no real scene graph - only custom BufferGeometry
and custom shaders wrapped in ShaderMaterial. Because UglyMol draws only
lines and "impostors" (a common technique in molecular graphics).
Therefore, the benefits of using three.js are debatable.
